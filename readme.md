## Introduction
This assignment focuses on feature detection and matching in images using the Harris corner detection method, SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform), and feature matching using Sum of Squared Differences (SSD) and ratio distance. The objective is to identify key points in images, describe their features, and match them to find correspondences.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation
To install the required libraries, run the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless numpy matplotlib
NOTE:change the image directory in the code to the respective directory.
